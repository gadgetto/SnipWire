# SnipWire - ProcessWire Plugin
[Snipcart](https://snipcart.com) is a powerful, developer-first 3rd party HTML/JavaScript shopping cart platform. **SnipWire** is the missing link between Snipcart and the content management framework [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com).

With **SnipWire**, you can quickly turn any **ProcessWire** site into a Snipcart online shop. The SnipWire plugin helps you to get your store up and running in no time. Detailed knowledge of the Snipcart system is not required.

SnipWire is free and open source! It would be nice if you could donate an amount to support further development:
