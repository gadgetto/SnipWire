# SnipWire vs Snipcart vs ProcessWire
[Snipcart](https://snipcart.com) is a powerful, developer-first 3rd party HTML/JavaScript shopping cart platform. **SnipWire** is the missing link between Snipcart and the content management framework [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com).

With **SnipWire**, you can quickly turn any **ProcessWire** site into a Snipcart online shop. The SnipWire plugin helps you to get your store up and running in no time. Detailed knowledge of the Snipcart system is not required.

## Plugin Key Features
- Fast and simple store setup
- Full integration of the Snipcart dashboard into the ProcessWire backend (no need to leave the ProcessWire admin area)
- Browse and manage orders, customers, discounts, abandoned carts, and more
- Process refunds and send customer notifications from within the ProcessWire backend
- Complete Snipcart webhooks integration (all events are hookable via ProcessWire hooks)
- Integrated taxes provider (which is more flexible then Snipcart own provider)
